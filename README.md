# AD-NEGF
This is a python package for quantum transport calculations implemented with Non-equilibrium Green's Function method.
The whole method is implemented with PyTorch, with custom automatic differentiations. Therefore, it is able to perform gradient computation of the transport properties w.r.t. input variables - such as Hamiltonians, atomic positions, etc.


Please see the tutorial.ipynb for usage.
